# Structure of Patterns

Design patterns offer solutions to common design problems, providing a reusable template. Below is a structured approach to document these patterns:

## 1. Pattern Name
- **Description:** A unique and descriptive name that summarizes the pattern, making it easy to identify and refer to.

## 2. Problem
- **Context:** 
  - What is the recurring issue the pattern addresses?
  - Situations or circumstances where this pattern is relevant, highlighting why the problem needs a solution.
  
## 3. Solution
- **Mechanism:** 
  - A high-level overview of how the pattern resolves the problem.
  - Detailed description of the core concept that defines the pattern, including any key principles and strategies.

## 4. Consequences
- **Impacts:** 
  - The results of using the pattern, including benefits (e.g., improved code maintenance, scalability) and drawbacks (e.g., increased complexity).
  - Discuss trade-offs involved, and how they affect the overall design and system performance.

## 5. Implementation
- **Guidelines:** 
  - Detailed steps or methodologies for implementing the pattern in software development.
  - Common pitfalls and challenges, alongside recommendations to overcome them.
  - Considerations for adapting the pattern to specific programming languages or frameworks.

## 6. Example
- **Illustration:** 
  - A concrete example demonstrating the application of the pattern.
  - Step-by-step explanation of how the pattern is implemented in this example.

```plantuml
@startuml
interface Observer {
  update(data: WeatherData)
}

class WeatherData {
  - observers: List<Observer>
  + registerObserver(o: Observer)
  + removeObserver(o: Observer)
  + notifyObservers()
  + measurementsChanged()
}

class CurrentConditionsDisplay implements Observer {
  + update(data: WeatherData)
}

WeatherData -> Observer: notifies
Observer <|-- CurrentConditionsDisplay
@enduml
```

## Related Patterns
- **Relationships:** 
  - Describe other patterns that are related, either as alternatives or complementary solutions.
  - Explain how this pattern can be integrated with other patterns to address different aspects of a problem.

```plantuml
@startuml
interface Mediator {
  notify(sender:object, event:string)
}

class ConcreteMediator implements Mediator {
  + notify(sender: object, event: string)
  + manageInteraction()
}

Participant -> Mediator: communicates through
Mediator <|-- ConcreteMediator
@enduml
```

# Example: Observer Pattern

## Pattern Name
- **Observer Pattern**

## Problem
- **Context:** 
  - In a scenario where multiple objects need to stay updated with the state of another object without tight coupling.
  - Often arises in GUI applications where user interface components need to display and update based on changing data.

## Solution
- **Mechanism:** 
  - Establish a one-to-many relationship between a subject and its observers.
  - The subject keeps a list of its observers, adds or removes them as needed, and notifies them of any state changes, allowing observers to react accordingly.

## Consequences
- **Impacts:** 
  - Loose coupling between the subject and its observers, promoting scalability and ease of maintenance.
  - Observers can be added or removed dynamically without affecting the subject.
  - However, can result in a large number of objects needing to be managed, requiring careful observer management and synchronization.

## Implementation
- **Guidelines:** 
  - Implement an interface for observers to define the update method.
  - Make the subject maintain a list of observers, and provide methods to add, remove, and notify them.
  - Ensure that the notification process does not tightly bind business logic to observer management.

## Example
- **Illustration:** 
  - Consider a weather station system where the `WeatherData` class updates various display elements with current conditions. The `CurrentConditionsDisplay` implements the `Observer` interface and updates its display whenever notified of changes in the weather data.

```plantuml
@startuml
interface Observer {
  update(data: WeatherData)
}

class WeatherData {
  - observers: List<Observer>
  + registerObserver(o: Observer)
  + removeObserver(o: Observer)
  + notifyObservers()
  + measurementsChanged()
}

class CurrentConditionsDisplay implements Observer {
  + update(data: WeatherData)
}

WeatherData -> Observer: notifies
Observer <|-- CurrentConditionsDisplay
@enduml
```

## Related Patterns
- **Observer with Mediator:** 
  - If complex communication is needed across observers without direct dependencies, the Mediator pattern can facilitate this interaction.
  - Mediator can coordinate interaction among observers, reducing direct connections between them and promoting cleaner communication.

```plantuml
@startuml
interface Mediator {
  notify(sender:object, event:string)
}

class ConcreteMediator implements Mediator {
  + notify(sender: object, event: string)
  + manageInteraction()
}

Participant -> Mediator: communicates through
Mediator <|-- ConcreteMediator
@enduml
```
